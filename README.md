## 🧠 What is an ER Diagram?

An **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** is a visual blueprint of a database. It shows how entities like **people**, **objects**, or **concepts** relate to each other within a system.

## 🚀 How to Build an ER Diagram from Requirements

Follow these 3 essential steps to design a clean and professional ER Diagram:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Understand Project Requirements

Before designing, **analyze your project's scope**:

- What is the system trying to solve?
- What data needs to be stored?
- What are the business rules?
- What actions will users perform?

📌 *Example:*  
_For a Library Management System — think about books, members, librarians, loans, returns, etc._

---

### ✅ Step 2: Identify Entities & Relationships

From the requirements, extract the following:

#### 🔸 **Entities** (Nouns):
- Real-world objects or concepts like `Book`, `Member`, `Loan`, `Librarian`.

#### 🔹 **Attributes** (Properties of Entities):
- For `Book`: `Title`, `Author`, `ISBN`, `Publisher`.
- For `Member`: `Name`, `MembershipDate`, `PhoneNumber`.

#### 🔗 **Relationships** (Verbs):
- `Member` *borrows* `Book`
- `Librarian` *manages* `Loan`

Also identify:
- 🔐 Primary Keys (PK)
- 🔄 Foreign Keys (FK)
- Cardinality (1:1, 1:M, M:N)

---

### ✅ Step 3: Draw the ER Diagram

Use any visual tool like:
- **draw.io**
- **Lucidchart**
- **dbdiagram.io**
- **ERDPlus**

📌 Represent:
- **Entities** as rectangles
- **Attributes** as ovals
- **Relationships** as diamonds
- Connect using lines, and define cardinality.
